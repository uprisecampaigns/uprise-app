People do not make revolution eagerly any more than they do war. There is this difference, however, that in war compulsion plays the decisive r√¥le, in revolution there is no compulsion except that of circumstances. 

A revolution takes place only when there is no other way out. And the insurrection, which rises above a revolution like a peak in the mountain chain of its events, can no more be evoked
 at will than the revolution as a whole. 

The masses advance and retreat several times before they make up their minds to the final assault.Conspiracy is ordinarily contrasted to insurrection as the deliberate undertaking of a minority to a 
spontaneous movement of the majority.

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. So I've got news for you, John McCain. That is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience that the task requires. People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind, heart, and soul.

They know they have to work hard to get ahead - and they want to. It's that folks are hungry for change - they're hungry for something new. The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its people.

Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. No health care? The market will fix it. This truth transcends nations and peoples - a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't Christian, or Muslim or Jew.

And meeting them won't be easy. Out of work? Tough luck. We all put our country first. Because I've seen it. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles.

We have real enemies in the world. Like other black churches, Trinity's services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. What's remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but rather how many men and women overcame the odds; how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them. It is where our union grows stronger. It is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied. The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the Road Map are clear.

We will all have to make concessions to achieve this. But what we know - what we have seen - is that America can change. For we have a choice in this country. For decades, there has been a stalemate: two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive. And I will host a Summit on Entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world.

And I heard Reverend Jeremiah A. And there's another issue we must confront as well.

I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. That won't keep America safe. But we should choose the right path, not just the easy path.
