I'm running for Governor of Virginia because our state must be a firewall against hate, corruption and an assault on the Virginia values of decency and progress. That is a wall worth building! This election is not just about the next four years -- but the next generation. Together we can demand better wages, more time with family, paid family leave and better, more affordable education. This is a fight to reclaim the politics and policies of our state for the people and the problem-solvers. You and I can fight together -- and if we stand strong by our values and refuse to back down, I believe we can win.

We need to focus on common sense policies that work for the 22nd Senate District, that do not overburden our localities.  We need to acknowledge that education drives our economy: no company is going to move to our area if we donâ€™t have a strong workforce. This is going to be my focus throughout this campaign and in the Virginia Senate.
