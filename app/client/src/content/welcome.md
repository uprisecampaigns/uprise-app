Here’s what you will find in our main menu:
-------------------------------------------

### Search

Find and sign up for volunteer [ACTIONS](/search/search-actions), or find [CAMPAIGNS](/search/search-campaigns) that you
can subscribe to and hear about all their actions.

### 

### Manage

Keep track of your volunteering commitments at [MY ACTIONS](/volunteer/action-commitments) and manage
your campaign subscriptions at [MY SUBSCRIPTIONS](/volunteer/campaign-subscriptions).

### 

### Organize

Manage all your campaigns at [MY CAMPAIGNS](/organize) and make new ones at [CREATE CAMPAIGN](/organize/create-campaign).

Inside each CAMPAIGN, you will find a menu for creating and managing
CAMPAIGN ACTIONS, managing and contacting your VOLUNTEERS and editing
your campaign SETTINGS, which include account information, search
preferences and location, and where you can view or edit your campaign
profile.

Each ACTION has a DASHBOARD, where you can view and contact the people
who signed up and open your SETTINGS menu, which includes basic
information and search preferences, and where you can view and edit your
action profile.

### 

### Settings

Manage your [ACCOUNT](/settings/account), change your password and read our privacy policy
at [PRIVACY & SECURITY](/settings/privacy-security). You can also [CONTACT US](/settings/contact), or [LOGOUT](/logout).
